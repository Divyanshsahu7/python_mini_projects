# Python Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of small, beginner-friendly Python projects
built to improve logic building, problem-solving skills, and understanding of
core Python concepts. Each project is simple, practical, and designed to help
me learn by doing.

These mini projects cover a variety of topics such as loops, functions,
modules, file handling, OOP, and basic algorithms. The goal of this repository
is to keep improving daily by creating small but useful programs that can be
expanded or reused later in larger applications.
